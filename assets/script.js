// Open game in new game.html & start game

startBtn {
    startBtn.addEventListener("click", );
}

//I struggle with this everytime, but how in the love of god do I move the cute boxes to the center??
//why is my html "return to home" tab (the OG index.html) not returning to home??
//why is my pseudo code ::before not doing anything, I have big dreams w/ these custom buttons
